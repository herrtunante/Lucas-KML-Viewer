# Lucas-KML-Viewer

This is a simple approach to make the LUCAS 2015 data ( https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/lucas/data/primary-data/2015 ) more accesible as it generates KML file with the data country by country.

The KMLs contain all of the points registered in the CSV file and let you visualize the pictures that were taken by the surveyors.
